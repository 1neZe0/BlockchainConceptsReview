Proof of Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism for blockchain networks that aims to be more energy-efficient and cost-effective than PoW. In a PoS system, validators (or "stakers") are chosen to verify transactions and add new blocks to the chain based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" as collateral.

Validators are incentivized to act honestly, as any attempt to manipulate the system or validate fraudulent transactions would result in the loss of their staked cryptocurrency.
